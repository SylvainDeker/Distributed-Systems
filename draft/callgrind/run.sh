# Use --auto=yes to get annotated source code for all relevant functions
  #for which the source can be found
# For branch prediction simulation, use --branch-sim=yes. Expect a further slow down approximately by a factor of 2.

# If the program section you want to profile is somewhere in the middle of the run,
  # it is beneficial to fast forward to this section without any profiling,
  #and then enable profiling.

# This is achieved by using the command line option --instr-atstart=no and running, in a shell: callgrind_control -i on just before the interesting code section is executed. To exactly specify the code position where profiling should start, use the client request CALLGRIND_START_INSTRUMENTATION.

# assembly code level annotation =>  --dump-instr=yes (This will produce profile data at instruction granularity, viewed with KCachegrind)
# details of the control flow inside of functions, i.e. (conditional) jumps. =>--collect-jumps=yes.
