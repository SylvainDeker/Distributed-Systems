    "This notebook is a quick demonstration of the DASK library. DASK is designed for distributed computing in Python. The architecture of such a system possesses a Scheduler, several Workers and several clients (only one client is used here). The user who wants to run distributed computing connects its client to the scheduler, then the scheduler divides data into 'partitions' and assignes them to the different workers. In this notebook, Client() is configured in distributed mode but runs locally the scheduler and the workers by itself.\n"

Let's start with an example of list of string (here a string contains a number). The argument npartitions=5 is optionnal, it is set to 5 here for an in-depth understanding of the system behavior. Given the short lenght of the list, if this optional argument was not set explicitly, it would automaticaly be set to 1, hence without any parallelization. The method .from_sequence() loads data from the client to the scheduler so we usually set a small amount of data in the list (ex: filenames, references, indexes, etc...). The result returned is a dask.bag, an object on which it is possible to apply lazy computation."
